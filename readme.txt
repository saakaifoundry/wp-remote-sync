== Description ==

* Set this plugin up in two different wordpress instances.
* One is the "remote", this one doesn't need any settings at all.
* One is the "local", this one should be set up to point at the remote.
* From the local instance, you can do operateins similar to those git provides, i.e. push, pull, etc.
